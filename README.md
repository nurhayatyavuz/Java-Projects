# Simple Bank Account Application
This project is a simple Java console application that performs basic bank account operations (deposit, withdraw, view balance).
## About the Project

This project is a simple bank account simulation developed in Java. It includes the following features:

*   Creating new accounts
*   Depositing money
*   Withdrawing money
*   Checking balance
*   Displaying account information

The project uses basic Java concepts (classes, objects, methods) and console-based input/output operations.
## How It Works

The application works by taking input from the user via the console. The user selects an operation from the menu (e.g., deposit). Then, they enter the necessary information (e.g., the amount to deposit). The application performs the corresponding operation using this information and prints the result to the screen.
